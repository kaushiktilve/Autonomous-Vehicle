## Autonomous Vehicle

Take a look at the small-scale Automous Vehicle we built for our Automotive Electronics class project! 

Here are some of the details of this project completed by:
1. _Sanket Bachuwar_
2. _Yong He_
3. _Akil Patheria_
4. _Kaushik Tilve_

_(From L to R: Yong, Akil, Kaushik, Sanket)_

Primary tasks for this project included:

```
## Ultrasonic distance Filtering
• Sensor values filtering using Kalman Filter
• Piece-wise fitting using appropritate caliberation function

## Electronic Speed Control (ESC) and Sterring Servo Motor Control (SSM)
• We've used PID control to model our ESC and SSM
• Giving our input as pulsed waveform (PWM) we controlled both motors in tandem

### Lane Keeping
• The car should be inside the lane marker, not deviating outside of it

## Adaptive Cruise Control 
• It needs to eventually come to a halt or adjust speed accordingly to a front obstacle or a car ahead 
```

**Achievements**
1. Fastest recorded car time around the track (17 seconds)
2. Covered all 5 checkpoints inside the lane markers
3. Stopped precisely 300 mm from front obstacle
